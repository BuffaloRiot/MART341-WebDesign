# Welcome to my world

## Hello my name is **Bufflo Riot**

  Im an Inidgenous Two-Spirit Artist rooted in Justice, Liberation and Resistance. I'm *Blackfeet, Assiniboine and FortPeck Sioux* but culturally rasied with the *Lakota people*. Some may call me a mutt but I like to consider myself a baby of the warrior people. I do not only come from one tribe, I come from many. Inspiring me to be proud of the people I come from and their stories of survival. 

  I often find myself in spaces pushing for justice for Inidgenous people and those who are denied the rights/peace they deserve. Opening up avenues to talk about what does liberation look like with in cultural diverse solidarty and sovereignty. Inturn building the foundations of resistances in all forms of living and systamic structure we all participate in or are forced to. 

  Id like to share a link to a podcast that really inspired me to form my artistic voice with in anything I do:
