I'll be continuing adding functions to my assignment from last week. 


## Sizing – Control the width and height of elements on the page. 

        Done:  I had add min-height + max-height: auto; in my parent container for my pictures. 

## Overflow – Manage how content is displayed when it exceeds the element’s boundaries.

        Done: I have added an overflow function to everyone photo and heading. Making sure the overflow stays with its boundaires. 

## Border – Define and style borders around elements for emphasis or separation.
        
        Done: I had added double borders to my photo borders and header 

## Margin – Adjust the space outside an element, creating separation from other elements.
        
        Done: I had adjusted the margins to my images with the top and bottom being auto, with the sides at 22px. Created a well spaces visual. 

## Padding – Set the space inside an element, between its content and border.
        Done: I had created padding specs for only my images, so they all share the same specs. 

## Display: Inline / Inline-block – Specify how elements are displayed in relation to others.

        Done: I had displayed a hypothetical navagation bar, my sections are displayed inline-block so people could hypothetically navagate. Although I didn't know how to center so I floated them to the right. 

## Dropdown – Create a dropdown menu for navigation or content organization.
        This was extremely stressful trying to figure out. I wasn't able to do this. 

## Position – Control the placement of elements with properties like absolute, relative, or fixed.
        Done: I had added realtive postioning to my navagation bar at the top of my webpage.
