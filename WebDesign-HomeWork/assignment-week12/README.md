I'll be continuing adding functions to my assignment from last week. 


## Sizing – Control the width and height of elements on the page. 

        Done:  I had add min-height + max-height: auto; in my parent container for my pictures. 

## Overflow – Manage how content is displayed when it exceeds the element’s boundaries.

        Done: I have added an overflow function to everyone photo and heading. Making sure the overflow stays with its boundaires. 

## Border – Define and style borders around elements for emphasis or separation.
        
        Done: I had added double borders to my photo borders and header 

## Margin – Adjust the space outside an element, creating separation from other elements.


## Padding – Set the space inside an element, between its content and border.


## Display: Inline / Inline-block – Specify how elements are displayed in relation to others.


## Dropdown – Create a dropdown menu for navigation or content organization.


## Position – Control the placement of elements with properties like absolute, relative, or fixed.
