<h3><b>Portfolio</b></h3>


<P> Creating a portfolio would help house all my personal and professional projects I've create or am in the porcess of creating. 
I would have one main page with highlights of my favrote works, then catagories that could be click on to dive more into the specific realms of my expertise and creations. I'd also have a page of recommendations or peer/profeesional reflections of people experiences with me. 
This would allow anyone to get a sense of the things I do and who I am</P>

<h3><b>Personal Blog</b></h3>

<p> When I think of personal blog I see an opprotuniity of building a community through my own efforts of sharing my personal perspective and sharing truths from all over. 
    I'd like to build a website with a main page with stories I've selected to share with a community comment or chat underneath all of them for people to enagage with. 
    Of course with certain regulations so people are following community guideline and being respectable to one another. I also want to share and eleboarte deeply on organizing efforts 
    and critical issues of all sorts. I think this personal blog would help build my public speaking or just critical thinking skills. 

    I'd also have a page for discussion post for others to engage with. or be able to share things they think are important as well. The design of this would be creative with a accessable navagation and information.

<h3><b>Small Business Website</b></h3>

<p> In the hopes of starting a entertain, media and security business or agency having a website with be a huge asset in opperations and reacting the public. 
     This website will be able to break down into mission and goals, contact information, servicess, bios, community reviews and highlights of our efforts. 
    This colors and themes of this website would be bold. I'm also thinking there would be sub websites for the different services, or pages that eleaborate more into depth with what we 
    do in different sectors.
