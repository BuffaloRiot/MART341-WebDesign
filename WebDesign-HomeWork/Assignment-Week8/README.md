Div (at least 2)

I used a Div to coustimize my title card 





Span (at least 2)

Audio (at least 1)

Video ( at least 1 )
I used a video as my title card for my mainpage! I loved this incorpration but I'm not sure about the copy right on this video though. You may not agree with this prespective, but as an Indigenous person apart of my resistance is reclaiming archival footage and still images of native people. This video thats underneath my title is of a Great North American Bison. The Tatanka or iinni, otherwise as none as bison, are a sacred animal to Indigenous people that were almost killed to the point of icstintion during colonization. Which eventually lead them to being intutionalized by white saviorism and forced into the vision of the Great American dream.
