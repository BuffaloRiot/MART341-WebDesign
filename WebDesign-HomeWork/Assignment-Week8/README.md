# Report: Discriptions on how I implemented newly learned functions in my website


<!-- (e.g., "Div: I used <div> elements to group the recipes on my page. This helped organize the layout and provides a framework for future pages.") -->



Div (at least 2) -  Done 

I used a Div to try to cosumize my bio and insporation on the Main page 





Span (at least 2)

Audio (at least 1)

Video ( at least 1 ) - Done 
I used a video as my title card for my mainpage! I loved this incorpration but I'm not sure about the copy right on this video though. You may not agree with this prespective, but as an Indigenous person apart of my resistance is reclaiming archival footage and still images of native people. This video thats underneath my title is of a Great North American Bison. The Tatanka or iinni, otherwise as none as bison, are a sacred animal to Indigenous people that were almost killed to the point of icstintion during colonization. Which eventually lead them to being intutionalized by white saviorism and forced into the vision of the Great American dream. 

I felt the need to explain this, especially as a Native student taking this course.
