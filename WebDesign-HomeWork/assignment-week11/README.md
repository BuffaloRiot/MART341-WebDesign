##  I had adjust font-weight for emphasis, my photo titles. 
        Adjust spacing (letter-spacing, line-height, or word spacing) for readability: I had adjusted my font spacing in my main title "photo gallery but I'm debating to change the font because the style of it looked cool but being used, theres not alot of detail in the design to pull the letter out a bit more. 

        I also used letter spacing for my subtitle "Natures Creation" 
        
## I used text-decoration to add underlines, lines through in my title affects.
