# Reflection 

This week was a little hard trying to motivate myself inorder develop this website futher. When I finally did, it pieced together very nicely. I added a page with a form for people to use if they're trying to contact me. Other components were I implemented a table, and added more discriptive code into images. I'm very proud of my table on the first page. It cleaned up my powerword display, finally centering the words through problem solving. This week was full of applying myself and finding ways to tweak code for it work.
