# Reflection 

This week was a little hard trying to motivate myself to develop this website futher. When I finally did, it pieced together very nicely. I added a page for form for people to use to contact me and implemented a table, and added more discriptive code into images. I'm very proud of my table on the first page. It cleaned up my powerword display very nicely and I problem solved, figuing out a way to center the table. This week was full of applying myself and problem solving.
