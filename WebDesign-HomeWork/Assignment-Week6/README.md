# Buffalo Riot Portfolio 

I've decided to expand on a personal portfolio for my art, values and artist idenity. I'd like to define this website into something that displays my work in a theme personalized to my artist idenity. Maybe with colors of black, white, and red used for word fonts or  boarders of images. Photos and maybe videos would also be central aspect for navagation. So show, not tell. 


Additional thoughts:
When developing my idea of a personal portfolio, I notice how I had to adjust my color balance through out. Sometimes I'd get overwelmed with red or white as a font color it just flooeded the infromation being displayed. I also used blackspace to complement the white and red themes within the layout. 

Although I wasn't able to have my power words fit like I wanted them to, I was able to work with definitions as a function to condense the information on the page. For the most part my layout when accordingly. 


I was able to work with float and margin a little bit for my buffalo heads at the top of page. At first I had a hard time placing the code and the second picture kept messing with alignment. Then I figured out its best to have both of the pictures listed after one another, then add the title. 

I had many successes but some difficulty with moving my list. I wanted to have list aligned in the center and on the right, not just left. Haven't figured that out quite yet. I also wanted to play with fontsize with out having to restructure things and change color codes constantly. Like, what if I wanted one paragraph one color and another a different color?  little details of stylizing I didn't really have the skills for.
