# Buffalo Riot Portfolio 

I've decided to expand on a personal portfolio for my art, values and artist idenity. I'd like to define this website into something that displays my work in a theme personalized to my artist idenity. Maybe with colors of black, white, and red used for word fonts or  boarders of images. Photos and maybe videos would also be central aspect for navagation. So show, not tell.
